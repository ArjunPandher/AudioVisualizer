            "The Alchemist's versatile production soundtracks some of Gangsta Gibbs' best flows and performances yet on Alfredo." - The Needle Drop
            "By this point, neither Gibbs nor the Alchemist have much of anything to prove—the former has been rapping circles around nearly everyone for the last five or six years, and the latter has been a go-to beatmaker for A-list rappers since the turn of the century. But their pairing here seems particularly inspired, even within the context of each other’s individual producer/rapper collaborative albums." - Pitchfork
